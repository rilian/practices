Best practices on software development
=========

Testing
=========

* Black-box tests are better than test relying on method implementation

```ruby
# bad

#TODO: example

# good

#TODO: example

```

Naming
=========

* in DB, Boolean columns should have prefix `is_` or `has`

    example1
    example2

* methods returning Boolean should have `?` postfix

    example1
    example2

REST APIs
=========

* API calls should have no more than one ID in the base path

    example1
    example2


WORK Process
=========

TODO: This section should help and point to some organizational notes that simplify development, team communication
